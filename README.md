# SkinCancerCNN

## Built a web App for our Deep Learning Model and deployed it one Firebase, connected our web app to the domain name which we registered on domain.com:
https://detectskincancerbu.tech/


Data Set: https://www.kaggle.com/fanconic/skin-cancer-malignant-vs-benign

A patient uploads their skin image on our website. That image runs through our trained Convoluted Neural Network (CNN) model, which gives a data-driven decision on whether that patient is suffering from skin cancer.

# How we built it
We coded the CNN in Python using pandas, and used react to build the website 

# Challenges we ran into
1) Exporting the database to GitHub repository 
2) improving accuracy of deep learning model 
3) exporting the model to embed it into the website 
4) connecting firebase to custom domain

# File Descriptions
1) Skin Cancer Classifier.ipynb - Contains the main code for running the deep learning model 
2) resize.ipynb - contains a function to reasize any image to that of our required size
3) archive - contains training and test data 
4) saved_model.pb - contains final implementation code

# What we learned
1) Ideating and concluding a project within 24 hours 
2) Collaborating in a team and delegating tasks based on individual strengths
3) Smoothly integrating Deep learning model with front end
