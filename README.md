# SkinCancerCNN

Data Set: https://www.kaggle.com/fanconic/skin-cancer-malignant-vs-benign
A patient uploads their skin image on our website. That image runs through our trained Convoluted Neural Network (CNN) model, which gives a data-driven decision on whether that patient is suffering from skin cancer.
# How we built it
We coded the CNN in Python using pandas, and used react to build the website 
# Challenges we ran into
1) Exporting the database to GitHub repository 
2) improving accuracy of deep learning model 
3) exporting the model to embed it into the website 
4) connecting firebase to custom domain
# Accomplishments that we're proud of
1) achieving accuracy of 87% on our test data 
2) get a user-friendly website to function
# What we learned
1) Ideating and concluding a project within 24 hours 
2) Collaborating in a team and delegating tasks based on individual strengths
3) Smoothly integrating Deep learning model with front end 
# What's next for Detecting Skin Cancer using Deep Learning
1) getting more data to be able to train our model better 
2) making the website more user-friendly
